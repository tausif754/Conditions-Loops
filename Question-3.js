/*
Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.
*/

/*
Loops are programming constructs that allow a set of instructions to be repeated multiple times. 
They are essential for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. 
Loops help in reducing redundancy and make the code more efficient. There are several
types of loops in most programming languages, including JavaScript. The main types of loops are:

1. For loop
Syntsx:
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to be executed in each iteration
}
Example:-
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. While loop
Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed as long as the condition is true
}
Example:-
let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. Do While loop
Syntax:
do {
    // Code to be executed at least once, then repeatedly as long as the condition is true
} while (condition);
Example:-
let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
